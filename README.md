# Odin Landing Page

A simple, static landing page for a website built from scratch using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The goal for this project is to recreate an entire web page from a provided design, with a focus on utilizing Flexbox layouts.

You can see a live demo of the recreated website [here](https://lilnerddev.github.io/odin-landing-page/).

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum â€” a free, open-source, and community-driven platform for learning full-stack web development.

## ðŸ¥¢ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Git** and **GitHub** for version control
- **Linux CLI** (Command Line Interface)
- **Xubuntu** (via VirtualBox)

This project was developed entirely inside a VirtualBox VM running **Xubuntu**, providing an opportunity to practice working in a Linux environment â€” including terminal navigation, file management, and Git usage from the command line.

## What I Learned

- Structuring web pages using semantic HTML
- Styling pages with CSS using Flexbox
- Using Git for version control and pushing code to GitHub
- Navigating and managing files in a Linux environment via the terminal

## Design Inputs

Two images are provided as input. The first is an image of the complete website and the second includes some details about some of the fonts and colors used.
